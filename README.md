# GraduationTracker

A Blazor application written in C# that helps DePauw University students track their graduation requirements.

The application allows the user to:
- choose their major and/or minor
- input classes taken (with grades, distribution areas and competencies)
- calculate their GPA and whether or not they will graduate with honors
- see which classes they still need to complete to finish their major and/or minor
